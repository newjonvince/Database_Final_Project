This project is the final project for my Database Systems course at NJIT.
It demonstrates the design and implementation of a complete relational database system integrated with an application layer.

The system supports full CRUD operations and models real-world relationships between employers and projects, enforcing data integrity and performance through proper schema design, constraints, and indexing.
